# Install-Kubernetes-Ubuntu
##  Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to install K8S on Ubuntu VM and learn the basics of K8S commands by applying it to my docker image [website hosted on Nginx container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/samir2296/containerization/tags?page=1) to configure manage, and keep the whole system running smoothly.
